Lecture 2: Theoretical Underpinnings of Ethics This week’s lecture covered the topic of ‘Theoretical Underpinnings of Ethics’. Ethics is essentially the exploration of ethical reasoning, which involves creating reasoned arguments for moral claims about what we should do, or what is/ought to be done, morally speaking. These reasoned arguments are essentially reasons for accepting claims; we often structure these as premises for accepting conclusions. To decide on which actions to take, the main forms of ethics are rule-based ethics (deontological), consequentialist ethics and virtue ethics (defining virtuous behaviour as a function of one’s character). The stamp of ethical thinking is that “ethics costs”. This is because we must account for the interests of others, but in deciding whose interests we necessarily care about, we must consider ethical relativism which is the claim that the truth of ethical judgements is relative to context and/or culture. There are two distinct branches of relativism – descriptive and normative. Descriptive relativism is the notion that people actually hold radically different moral values and these have changed over time. This is linked to descriptive ethics which investigates what people do, and what they think are the right things to do – describing their moral outlook. Normative relativism is the notion that different views are all equally true, and thus we shouldn’t judge. However, this is distinct from prescriptive/normative ethics which is the task of deciding what the right thing is to do, morally speaking. This way of thinking enables a structured top-down approach to ethical reasoning where a judgement can be made about a specific dilemma, through a rationale (reasoning through application of some principles), which is then generalisable (an appeal to a certain principle/principles). This allows for a concrete assessment based on more generalised, abstract principles. In deciding which moral principles are correct, there exists several trains of thought: teleology (consequentialism), deontology (rule-based), and virtue ethics. J.S. Mill and Peter Singer are renowned consequentialists falling under the umbrella of utilitarianists, whereas Immanuel Kant was a proponent of non-consequential thinking, founding what we now call “Kantian Ethics”. This form of ethics defines an action as moral if it is done for the sake of duty/role (for example promise-keeping), agents are responsible for their own actions, and there exists perfect and imperfect duties. It relies on a set of categorical imperatives or ‘maxims’ each of which are derived logically from the ones before it; the first formulation of which forms the basis of all others. On the other hand, J.S. Mill and W.D. Ross are both proponents of utilitarianism which defines moral actions as those which tend to promote happiness. This is a form of consequentialism as it rests on the idea that the consequences or results of actions (specifically the utility or happiness they provide) determine whether those actions are good or bad, right or wrong. Finally, virtue ethics regards the cultivation of desirable character traits such as honesty to act morally. In essence, the cultivation of virtues (internal) will allow one to act morally towards others (interpersonal). This idea was presented by Plato and furthered by Aristotle who made the distinction between “moral virtues” and “intellectual virtues” – acting morally versus thinking morally. Aristotle suggested that the ultimate “goal” of acting and thinking morally was to arrive at happiness. Virtue ethics is distinct from deontological/teleological thought as it relates to the cultivation of one’s character, as opposed to what actions one should perform. These constitute “private/individual morality” which concerns only us as individuals, which is further separated from “public/role morality”, which concerns us as public role players (for example a doctor, lawyer, or the CEO of a company). To reconcile these seemingly disparate moral theories, the notion of pluralism suggests that there is no one single moral theory or principle that is preferential to others. This links back to normative relativism as it recognises that there are different and diverse ethical positions across different cultures, times, places, and individuals that should be recognised; there is not necessarily one single correct principle. Huawei is a multinational technology corporation headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Initially a manufacturer of phone switches, they now specialise in the design and development of telecommunications equipment, as well as consumer electronics such as smartphones. They have grown substantially in the past 10 years and are ranked as the second-largest R&D investor in the world, fifth in US patents, deploying their products and services in over 170 different countries and areas. In 2018, Huawei overtook Apple as the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world behind Samsung, and in 2020 Huawei surpassed Samsung and Apple in the number of phones shipped worldwide. The company’s exceptional growth is largely due to its links with the Chinese government, who have provided them with $75 billion in tax breaks, financing, and cheap resources, enabling them to sell their products at extremely low prices, bankrupting their competitors. This was alarming to technology companies in the US and Europe since they were competing against both a technology company and a nation. Telecommunication companies like Verizon and T-Mobile were happy to buy such cheap equipment from Huawei and as a result most of the world – Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia – is dominated by Huawei equipment, with the notable exception of the US and Western Europe. Huawei has faced difficulties in these markets due to the lack of state support stemming from cybersecurity concerns, primarily from the US government, that Huawei’s infrastructure equipment may enable surveillance by the Chinese government. A recent parliamentary enquiry in the UK concluded there was “clear evidence of collusion” between Huawei and the CCP “apparatus”. These findings, and various others, indicate Huawei’s role as a means of extending China’s surveillance and suppression around the world. Huawei has faced various sanctions and restrictions from Western governments due to suspicions concerning Huawei’s data collection and monitoring policies. In September 2020, the US dealt a major blow to Huawei’s core smartphone business by cutting off Huawei’s chip supplies which resulted in a US$30 billion annual loss with revenues down 29%. The US has placed a trade ban on Huawei, stopping companies such as Google and Qualcomm from dealing with it – meaning Huawei phones can no longer run Android. Despite these sanctions, China has been able to gain power in the US by putting Huawei cellular gear in small rural areas which overlook nearly every nuclear missile and special operations base. Ethical Discussion Huawei’s affiliation with the Chinese government, raise important ethical concerns around Huawei providing a means for the Chinese government to conduct surveillance and espionage in foreign countries, posing a severe cyber-security threat, and the ethics of being government-funded and violating the basic principles of free market competition, overpowering competition in the telecommunications equipment industry. The main stakeholders involved in the first issue are individual consumers who are the end-users of Huawei equipment, governments on all sides (both Chinese and foreign), and Huawei itself. Huawei has long been suspected of assisting Chinese surveillance programs, and although they deny these claims, a recent discovery made by The Washington Post revealed over 100 leaked PowerPoint presentations which “strongly suggest Huawei’s participation in China’s surveillance programs”, indicating a suite of surveillance tools including voice recording analysis (using AI technology), prison monitoring, location tracking, facial recognition, Xinjiang surveillance (a region with a significant Uyghur Muslim population), and corporate monitoring. The second ethical issue includes other telecommunication production companies, such as Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson, as key stakeholders. Huawei’s access to one of the world’s cheapest labour forces and its government subsidies means it is always going to be cheaper than Scandinavian or American technology, removing the possibility for fair market competition. Deontological perspective: For IT companies, there are existing codes which are agreed upon by the profession, such as the ACS Code of Ethics, which help us to identify potential ethical issues and how to resolve them. Huawei violates two key points of the ACS Code of Ethics. 1. “The Primacy of the Public Interest: You will place the interests of the public above those of personal, business, or sectional interests”. Huawei clearly violates this point by placing the interests of their business above public interest, in that they continue to conduct surveillance to serve their own company (as they continue to be government-funded), and the Chinese government itself, disregarding the interests of the public by violating their fundamental right to privacy and anonymity that is to be expected from telecommunication providers. 3. “Honesty: You will be honest in your representation of skills, knowledge, services, and products.” Huawei continues to deny participation in China’s surveillance programs despite various discoveries indicating otherwise and are thus being dishonest about the data-collection capabilities of their products and services. Reporting from Wired suggesting that the Chinese “government doesn't limit itself to what the law explicitly allows” when it comes to national security. “All Chinese citizens and organisations are obliged to cooperate upon request with PRC intelligence operations—and also maintain the secrecy of such operations”, as stated in Article 7 of the 2017 PRC national intelligence-gathering activities law. Although denying these claims, by not cooperating with foreign intelligence services requesting backdoors into their products, Huawei will be unable to cleanse its reputation. The only obvious course of action here would be for Huawei to cooperate with foreign governments in allowing backdoors into their equipment, simultaneously eliminating foreign governments’ suspicion of espionage, and giving foreign users peace of mind when using Huawei products. This raises the question as to whether all technology companies should grant backdoor access to their products – however a more balanced approach would require this only from technology companies for whom there is evidence of wrongdoing. From a Kantian perspective, Huawei’s activities violate the first two formulations of the categorical imperative, in that they are conducting surveillance of the public despite not wishing that same activity be applied to them, and they are treating humanity as a means rather than an end through using public surveillance to provide the Chinese government with intelligence. It is highly unlikely that the figures in power at Huawei want their private conversations and activities monitored, and yet they provide the CCP with extraordinary surveillance capabilities both at home and abroad. This is characteristic of authoritative governments seeking to maintain power at all costs – even to the detriment of their own citizens. It is also important to consider the duties of various parties involved. The surveillance and use of data without the consent of the user violates a fundamental right to privacy and anonymity expected from telecommunication providers. Huawei has a duty to not use and transmit sensitive data back to the Chinese government for political gain and is obligated to be open and transparent about its use of confidential data. Governments are obligated to protect their citizens’ confidential information and online security – justifying the sanctions placed on Huawei by the US and Europe. Telecommunication companies in countries outside of China have a duty to not use equipment that poses a risk to both to the governments and users within that country, even when there is strong financial incentive for such companies to use competitively priced Huawei equipment. Consequentialist perspective: From a position of ethical egoism, it is obviously attractive for Huawei to continue to receive financial support from the Chinese government as this provides long-term security for the company. However, a more utilitarian perspective is needed to consider all parties involved. If Huawei doesn’t conform to the requirements of being completely transparent about its surveillance tactics, then users’ data and privacy is being wrongfully violated which could result in personal or professional distress caused by data leaks or breaches. Furthermore, the Chinese government may gain unfair and unlawful intelligence relating to military operations or otherwise which is harmful to foreign governments. Some actions to consider include owning up to past geo-political strategies used by Huawei and providing access to the US government to company data logs to eliminate reason for concern, should they wish to operate in the US. The US, on the other hand, wouldn’t need to reciprocate since there hasn’t been suspicion or evidence of espionage-related activity from US companies. Furthermore, if Huawei continues to be government-funded this creates unfair competition for other telecommunication equipment and smartphone providers since strong financial backing enables far-superior R&D and extremely competitive pricing. Additionally, the natural separation between “government” and “private-sector” is blurred. By reducing natural market competition, this could potentially create a monopoly over the telecommunications industry and leads to ambiguity around Huawei’s role as a means of extending Chinese suppression and power into foreign countries. Some actions to consider include reducing government subsidisation and separating Huawei from the Chinese government managerially. A utilitarian analysis of these potential actions reveals that, despite the financial risk of reduced government subsidies, Huawei would benefit by tapping into Western markets, expanding its business in an ethical, unambiguous way. Tensions between Western countries and China will ease, and Huawei will be unfettered by restrictions and sanctions. On the downside, telecommunication companies would face increased cost of equipment (resulting from reduced government subsidies), meaning higher prices for users. Bibliography: Huawei - Wikipedia.
